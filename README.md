Game Overview - There are 3 lanes - left(0) , Middle(1),Right(2) The palyer stand int the last row The obstacle will come from top in a randome lane and moves downward,row by row The player moves left/result to avoid the obstacle If obstacle reaches same lane as player then collision and game over

Variables - x - Lane step - obstacle position obstaclePos - Lane in which obstacle appears rand() % 3 - Generates obstacle lane _kbhit() - checks if key is pressed gtech() - reads arrow key sleep() - control speed

The left arrow and right arrow part ensures that the player doesn't cross the 3 lanes

Obstacle movement- The obstacle generates from top with --->obstaclePos = rand() % 3; step = 0; Then it moves down with --->sleep++;

Animation Part - Animation is created using --> system("cls"); Every time each loop ---> 1.Clears screen 2.Then empty rows 3.Generates obstacle in row 4.Put the palyer at bottom

Collision - Collisoin happen only when both the collision conditions are met. It means that --> Obstacle at bottom row and lane is player's lane If both row matches GAME OVER.

Limitations - This game does not contain --> 1.Scores 2.Lives 3.Difficulty levels 4.Restart Menu 5.High scores 6.Multiple obstacle
